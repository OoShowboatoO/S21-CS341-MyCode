#Sokoban Solver
Sokoban is a classic puzzle game where the player pushes boxes around a grid to reach designated target positions. The objective is to solve the puzzles by strategically moving boxes while avoiding deadlocks and obstacles.

This repository contains a Sokoban solver implemented using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS-based approach guarantees finding the shortest possible solution (if one exists), making it an efficient method for exploring all possible moves systematically.
